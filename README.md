# approximation_function_pyqt5_project_school-yandex

This is a program for creating linear and nonlinear approximations of functions.
This program was developed in Python using a set of PyQt5 libraries to create a graphical interface.
Linear approximation is performed using the 'pyplot' module in the 'matplotlib' library. 
Nonlinear approximation is performed using the 'curve_fit' method in the 'Scipy' library.
The program also uses a 'SQLite3' database.
